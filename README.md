# Login Redirect

Fixes websites bad post-login redirection functionality by redirecting you to the page you were at before taken to the login page

## Usage

<img width="640" alt="Screen Shot 2021-06-21 at 7 25 26 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6363089/122849989-bca32500-d2c9-11eb-8479-72292a84d952.png">

- `login url` refers to the url for the login page
- `redirect url` refers to the url that the website takes you to after login (the one you dont want to go to)

Both urls are exact match
